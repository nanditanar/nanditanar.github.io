        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Our project, "GreenPlate," is a sustainable food management system designed to effectively promote sustainable 
            eating and shopping habits. By minimizing food waste and encouraging the efficient use of resources, 
            GreenPlate aims to help users adopt a more sustainable lifestyle. The application provides functionality 
            for users to track their daily calorie intake, manage recipes, monitor ingredient quantities, and generate 
            optimized shopping lists. Through these features, GreenPlate allows users to make informed decisions about 
            their food consumption and shopping, contributing positively to environmental sustainability. In an era where 
            the world wastes over 2.5 billion tons of food a year, sustainability is crucial, and managing food resources 
            efficiently is imperative. GreenPlate addresses this by integrating tools that assist users in planning their 
            meals and shopping trips to reduce waste and maximize the use of available resources. By promoting practices 
            that support sustainability, GreenPlate plays a pivotal role in fostering responsible consumer habits, which 
            are essential for the long-term health of our planet.</p>

        <h2>Design & Architecture</h2>
        <p>The architecture of GreenPlate is built on the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, which facilitates a clear 
            separation of concerns and enhances the maintainability and scalability of the application. This architectural 
            choice is ideal for handling the dynamic features provided by GreenPlate. Several design patterns are employed 
            to ensure the robustness and flexibility of the application:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Singleton: Used for managing user sessions, ensuring that only one user instance is active at any given time.</li>
            <li>Strategy: Allows for flexible sorting mechanisms in recipe management, where different sorting strategies can be applied dynamically.</li>
            <li>Factory: Used for creating instances of various models and views, simplifying the management of these components.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>UML Diagrams</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This Design Class Diagram (DCD) provides an overview of the classes and relationships in the "GreenPlate" app.</li>
            <ol>
                <li>User Class: Central to the application, it includes attributes for username, password, height, weight, and gender. It's implemented as a Singleton, meaning only one instance exists at any given time, ensuring consistency across the application.</li>
                <li>LoginViewModel: Manages the login functionality with methods like `onLoginClicked()` and properties such as `user`, `successMessage`, and `errorMessage`. It validates input data and interacts with the `User` class.</li>
                <li>AccountCreationViewModel: Handles new account creation, validating input data and creating new user accounts. It utilizes the `User` class for account information.</li>
                <li>MealInfo Class: Represents the details of a meal, including name, calories, and date.</li>
                <li>InputMealViewModel: Processes meal input, verifying the validity of the data entered against the `MealInfo` class.</li>
                <li>IngredientsModel: Contains information about individual ingredients such as name, quantity, calories, and expiration date.</li>
                <li>IngredientsViewModel: Manages ingredient-related operations, like checking for ingredient existence, with a callback interface `IngredientCheckCallback` for response handling.</li>
                <li>RecipeModel: Represents a recipe with attributes like name, a map of ingredients and their quantities, and a flag indicating if there are enough ingredients for the recipe.</li>
                <li>RecipeViewModel: Manages recipe operations and interacts with the `RecipeModel`. It uses the Firebase database for storage and retrieval of recipe data. </li>
                <li>`db` (FirebaseDatabase instance) and `root` (DatabaseReference) are initialized using the Singleton pattern in `IngredientsViewModel` and `RecipeViewModel`. This ensures a single reference point for database operations related to ingredients and recipes.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Strategy: Allows for flexible sorting mechanisms in recipe management, where different sorting strategies can be applied dynamically.</li>
            <li>Factory: Used for creating instances of various models and views, simplifying the management of these components.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>User Interface</h2>
        <p>GreenPlate's user interface is designed with intuitiveness and ease of use in mind. The UI employs a simple yet effective layout that guides users through the functionalities seamlessly.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Meal Logging: Users can log their meals, including details such as calorie count and ingredients used.</li>
            <li>Recipe Management: Allows users to create, store, and manage recipes with an integrated ingredient inventory system.</li>
            <li>Shopping List Generation: Automatically populates shopping lists based on the ingredients needed for upcoming meals.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Insert Screenshots Here -->
        <ul>
            <li>Welcome Screen: The first screen users see when they open the app, providing options to either start using the app or exit.</li>
            <li>Meal Input Screen: Where users can enter meal details for tracking.</li>
            <li>Recipe Screen: Displays stored recipes and allows for the addition of new ones.</li>
            <li>Shopping List Screen: Shows the ingredients needed for the selected recipes, highlighting what needs to be purchased.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These screenshots not only demonstrate our app’s features but also highlight the user-friendly design and logical flow between different functionalities.</p>

        <h3>Reflections from contributors: </h3>
        <p>Tanvi - Having never worked with databases or Android Studio before, this project was definitely a challenge but I gained a 
            lot from it. I had also never really worked in a team trying to get a deliverable with hard deadlines, so that was also a 
            learning experience. I enhanced my skills in using MVVM architecture, understanding the nuances of Firebase integration, and 
            applying design patterns like Singleton and Strategy for a scalable and maintainable codebase. </p>
        <p>Shriya - I have also never worked with Firebase or Android Studio before, so there was a significant learning curve for me, but 
            after doing four sprints, I feel like I have a solid understanding of the concepts we implemented. I feel confident in my ability 
            to complete tasks for sprints without any external assistance. I also learned a lot about using Git in a real project setting; although 
            I knew the commands prior to this class, I actually feel comfortable using them now.  </p>
        <p>Nandita - This project was the first time that I had used or implemented Firebase in a project to store data. I’ve used Android Studio before, 
            but having this comprehensive and thorough understanding of MVVM architecture that I’ve gained from this class will help me become a better 
            technological developer moving forward. Additionally, I gained critical skills associated with utilizing Git and handling merge conflicts, 
            which is especially important to industry-level applications. After this class, I feel more comfortable utilizing and applying design patterns, 
            utilizing git, android studio, and firebase in real-world projects.</p>
        <p>Veena - Although I have had prior work experience with Android Studio and Git, I have definitely expanded my skills through this project.</p>
